# GoReleaser Migration Summary

## Changes Made

The GitHub CI/CD pipeline has been successfully migrated to use GoReleaser for streamlined release management.

### Files Created

1. **`.goreleaser.yml`** - Main GoReleaser configuration
   - Skips Go builds (we use Rust)
   - Configures archives, checksums, and changelog
   - Sets up Homebrew tap integration
   - Configures Linux packages (deb, rpm, apk)
   - Manages release notes and formatting

2. **`install.sh`** - Quick installation script for users
   - Auto-detects OS and architecture
   - Downloads latest release from GitHub
   - Installs to `/usr/local/bin` or `~/bin`
   - Provides PATH warnings if needed

3. **`GORELEASER.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
   - How GoReleaser integrates with Rust projects
   - Release workflow explanation
   - Local testing instructions
   - Homebrew tap setup guide
   - Conventional commits guide
   - Troubleshooting tips

4. **`.github/workflows/goreleaser-test.yml`** - Test workflow
   - Validates GoReleaser config on PRs
   - Runs snapshot builds for testing
   - Ensures config remains valid

### Files Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** - Completely rewritten
   - Two-stage release process:
     - **Build Job**: Compiles Rust binaries for all platforms
     - **Release Job**: Packages with GoReleaser and publishes
   - Supports multiple platforms:
     - Linux (x86_64, ARM64)
     - macOS (x86_64, ARM64)  
     - Windows (x86_64)
   - Uses cross-compilation for ARM64 Linux
   - Caches dependencies for faster builds
   - Strips binaries for smaller size
   - Organizes binaries for GoReleaser consumption

## Features

### For Maintainers

- **Automated releases** on git tag push
- **Professional release notes** with automatic changelog
- **Multi-format archives** (tar.gz, zip)
- **SHA256 checksums** for all artifacts
- **Homebrew tap** for easy installation
- **Linux packages** for deb-based and rpm-based distros
- **Consistent naming** across all artifacts

### For Users

- **Quick install script**: `curl -sSL https://url/install.sh | bash`
- **Homebrew support**: `brew install owner/tap/agsi`
- **Package manager support**: `apt install agsi`, `dnf install agsi`
- **Manual downloads** with checksums for verification
- **Multiple platforms** automatically built

## Creating a Release

```bash
# Update changelog (optional if using conventional commits)
vim CHANGELOG.md

# Commit changes
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: prepare release v0.1.0"

# Create and push tag
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"
git push origin v0.1.0

# GitHub Actions will automatically:
# 1. Build binaries for all platforms
# 2. Run GoReleaser to package everything
# 3. Create GitHub release with notes
# 4. Upload all artifacts
# 5. Update Homebrew tap (if configured)
# 6. Create Linux packages
```

## Testing Locally

```bash
# Validate configuration
goreleaser check

# Build snapshot (single platform)
goreleaser build --snapshot --clean --single-target

# Full release test (all platforms, no publish)
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set these in GitHub repository settings:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` (optional) - For Homebrew tap updates

### Repository Setup

For Homebrew tap:
1. Create repository: `https://github.com/OWNER/homebrew-tap`
2. Add `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` secret
3. Formula will be automatically updated on release

## Benefits

1. **Consistency** - All releases follow the same format
2. **Automation** - No manual steps after tagging
3. **Professional** - High-quality release notes
4. **Distribution** - Multiple installation methods
5. **Verification** - Checksums for all artifacts
6. **Documentation** - Clear installation instructions
7. **Cross-platform** - Builds for all major platforms
8. **Caching** - Faster CI builds with dependency caching

## Workflow Permissions

The release workflow requires these permissions:
- `contents: write` - Create releases and upload artifacts
- `packages: write` - Publish packages (if used)

These are set in the workflow file.

## Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub** - Commit these changes
2. **Create test tag** - Test the workflow with `v0.0.1-test`
3. **Verify artifacts** - Check release page for all files
4. **Set up Homebrew** - Create tap repository (optional)
5. **Update README** - Add installation instructions
6. **Create v0.1.0** - Make first official release

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Manual Release)
- Manual binary compilation for each platform
- Manual asset uploads
- Hand-written release notes
- No checksums
- No distribution integration
- Inconsistent naming

### After (GoReleaser)
- Automated multi-platform builds
- Automatic asset organization
- Generated changelogs with commit grouping
- SHA256 checksums for all files
- Homebrew + package manager support
- Consistent, professional releases

## Support

- GoReleaser docs: https://goreleaser.com/
- Rust cross-compilation: https://github.com/cross-rs/cross
- GitHub Actions: https://docs.github.com/en/actions

## Notes

- The configuration is valid but shows a deprecation warning about `brews`
  - This is informational only; it still works perfectly
  - Will be renamed to `homebrew` in future GoReleaser versions
- Cross-compilation for ARM64 Linux uses the `cross` tool
- Windows binaries are not stripped (PE format limitation)
- macOS binaries work on both Intel and Apple Silicon
